## Hi there 👋 I'm Maulana Dzikri

I am an Informatics graduate currently interning as an **IT Developer** at **OttoDigital**, working on backend development using **Go**, **Gin**, **GORM**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Redis**. I focus on building reliable and scalable backend systems, designing APIs, and modeling system flows using **UML (Sequence Diagram)**, with a strong interest in backend architecture and software engineering.
